# AI Resume Builder

A powerful full-stack MERN application that helps users create, manage, and download professional resumes with AI-powered assistance from Google's Gemini. Build impressive resumes quickly with intelligent suggestions for summaries and job descriptions, all within a modern and intuitive interface.

This project is divided into two main parts:

  * `/client`: The frontend, built with React, Vite, and Redux.
  * `/server`: The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## 📸 Features

  * **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login (using JWT and bcrypt).
  * **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete multiple resumes.
  * **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Integrates Google's Gemini model to generate professional summaries and compelling descriptions for work experience.
  * **File Uploads:** Users can upload a profile picture for their resume (handled by Multer).
  * **Dynamic Form Editing:** A smooth, multi-step form experience.
  * **State Management:** Centralized state management using Redux Toolkit.
  * **Real-time Feedback:** Modern UI notifications using `react-hot-toast`.
  * **Responsive Design:** Clean and accessible UI built with `lucide-react` for icons.
